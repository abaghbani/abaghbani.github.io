# Photoelectric effect



## Photoelectric

Kinetic energy is not depend on intensity of light but it’s depend on only frequency of light

$$E = h.f$$

- h: Planck constant = *6.62607015e−34 Js* (joule second)
- f: Frequency of light

$$V_s = \frac{E_{kmax}}{e}$$

- $V_s$: stopping potential (voltage)

`note: So energy could be in eV (electron volt)`

$$E_{kmax} = hf - \phi$$

- $\phi$: work function or energy needed to liberate an electron
- $f_o$: threshold frequency

$$f_o = \frac{\phi}{h}$$

# Electromagnetic

## Coulomb's law:
there is force between each two charge $F = K_e\frac{q_1q_2}{d^2}$, ($K_e$ is coulomb's constant: $8.988\times10^9 Nm^2/C^2$). \
then any charge create a field that can effect any other charge in his space so we call this field as _Electric Field_.
Electric field over a sphere with a charge inside $E = \frac{F}{q_t} = \frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_oR^2}  (N/C) (K_e = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_o})$

## Electric flux:
$$\phi_E = \oint\overline{E}.\overline{dA}$$

_where E ($\frac{N}{C}$ $\frac{newton}{colomb}$) is Electric field and A ($m^2$) is orthogonal tiny surface so $\phi_E$ unit is ${Nm^2}/C$_

## Quass's law
over a closed surface:
$$\phi_E = \frac{q_{Total}}{4\pi\varepsilon_oR^2} * 4\pi R^2 = \frac{q_{Total}}{\varepsilon_o}$$

_where q is total charge inside the closed surface and The constant $\varepsilon_o$ is [*vacuum electric permittivity*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permittivity)._

## Ampere's law
$$\oint\overline{B}.\overline{dl} = {\mu}I$$

## Faraday's law
changing magnetic flux => EMF (Electromotive Force)
$$\varepsilon_{EMF} = -\frac{d\phi_M}{dt}$$
where magnetic flux is $\phi_M = \oint B \cdot dA$

$$\varepsilon_{EMF} = \frac{W}{q} = \frac{\oint F.dl}{q} = \oint E.dl$$


$$\boxed{\oint\overline{E}.\overline{dl} = -\frac{d\phi_M}{dt}}$$

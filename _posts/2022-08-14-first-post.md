# First post

this is my first post with [jekyll/minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), it's so easy to use this tools, just write as you like in md (markdown) format and commit your post file, of course it's needed before to prepare a repo for using it.

A sample page is here [github.io](https://jekyll.github.io/minima)

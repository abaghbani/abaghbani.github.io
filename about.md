# Akbar Baghbani
## DSP engineer & FPGA designer

I am a highly experienced Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and FPGA Engineer with a strong background in wireless ommunication and high-speed digital design. My expertise spans the design, analysis, and development of advanced communication systems, specializing in Bluetooth and other protocols such as Wi-Fi and WPAN.

With extensive experience in FPGA design and high-speed RTL coding, I have worked on cutting-edge tecknology andling 5/10 Gbps data rates. I am proficient in high-speed board design and have a deep understanding of gigabit serial protocols, including PCIe, USB, HDMI/DP, and SAS/SATA. Additionally, I have significant expertise in memory interface technologies, including DDR3/DDR4, AXI4, DFI, and Memory Controllers.

My passion lies in developing innovative hardware solutions and pushing the boundaries of digital communication echnology. I am always eager to tackle complex challenges and contribute to advancing high-speed digital systems.

I usally post here about these subjects:

- DSP
- FPGA
- wireless communication (ASK/FSK, GFSK, D-QPSK, OFDM, QAM, lora,...)
- high-speed protocol
- Embedded programming

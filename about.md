Welcome!

I use this blog to keep track of my personal projects.

These can be FPGA reverse engineering projects, playing LEDs, figuring out how something
works under the hood, or sometimes just instructions on how to install a piece of
software.

My understanding of things goes up a lot when I write about them, so some posts are primarily
to educate myself about a topic: don't assume that I know what I'm talking about!

I can be reached by direct message through Twitter or you can file issues or questions about my
projects through GitHub.
